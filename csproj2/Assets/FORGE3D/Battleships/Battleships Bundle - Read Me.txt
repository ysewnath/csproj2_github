Thank you for purchasing Battleships!

>>> How to fix Shader CustomEditor warning?

 | Could not create a custom UI for the shader 'FORGE3D/Battleships/Turret Mobile'. The shader has the following: 'CustomEditor = ASEMaterialInspector'. Does the custom editor specified include its namespace? And does the class either derive from ShaderGUI or MaterialEditor?

This warning is completely harmless, which means you don't have Amplify Shader Editor installed. To fix the warning, please comment this line at the end of all shader files (Assets/FORGE3D/Battleships/Shaders/):

// CustomEditor "ASEMaterialInspector"
